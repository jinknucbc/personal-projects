  // What that means is we'll need a component that calls on this. Basically, this is responsible for what
  // goes inside each of the small "boxes" that represent the lists.
  // In order to make that happen, what we can do is receive maximum of three list item things or so, or set some kind
  // of limit measure, from the actual list and display it here. When the user clicks the card, however, it should redirect
  // them to the actual list itself where they can add, edit, or remove items of that list.
